# Pomodoro Timer

This is a React app which I decided to build as a challange. It's based on the _Pomodoro_ technique, a time management method which consists in alternating focus sessions (the "pomodoros") with short breaks, and a long break after a certain amount of sessions (usually 4).

I often use this method myself to avoid distractions, so I wanted to make my own Pomodoro app from scratch.

The web app consists of a single main section at the center of the page, which displays a clock with a clock hand that rotates as the timer goes, the control buttons to toggle the timer actions, and a counter that tracks the number of sessions completed.
